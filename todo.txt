tput cols in bash to get column width

this has to be done in the shell of the user

just write a bash script to do it

or you could send the column length in a the query string of a request to a server script
  and return the correct file based on that
but I'd rather not put effort into two different scripts
cause I still have to write the bash script

put this in the bashrc
alias ls='ls | cat ~/.obiwan && echo && echo "THESE ARE NOT THE FILES YOU ARE LOOKING FOR" && echo && ls'
